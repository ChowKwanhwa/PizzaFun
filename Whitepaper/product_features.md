## Product Features

### Overview

PizzaFun represents a revolutionary Bitcoin token trading ecosystem that innovatively introduces a dual-layer trading mechanism and decentralized governance structure. The platform's core provides comprehensive token creation, high-speed trading, and liquidity management functionality, while utilizing advanced Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) technology to ensure a balance between asset security and transaction speed. The platform's innovative approach combines dynamic bonding curve trading with Automated Market Maker (AMM), creating a unique ecosystem that enables full lifecycle management of Bitcoin tokens from issuance to circulation.

A distinctive feature of PizzaFun is its lightning trading system specifically designed for the Bitcoin network. Based on the CrustNet backend infrastructure, transaction confirmation time is reduced from the traditional 10 minutes to 2 seconds while maintaining decentralized nature and security. This revolutionary combination of transaction speed and zero Gas fees brings unprecedented liquidity and user experience to the Bitcoin token market.

### Core Platform Functions

PizzaFun's platform architecture is built on three fundamental pillars that work synergistically to create an efficient and secure ecosystem:

1. **High-Speed Token Trading System** forms the core, providing a decentralized platform for token issuance, trading, and liquidity management. The market adopts an innovative dual-phase trading model, from initial bonding curve (y = e^x) to mature AMM curve (k = X * Y), ensuring smooth transition of tokens from issuance to mature market. The "Quick Trade" feature allows users to execute buy/sell operations at millisecond speed without waiting for confirmation screens.

2. **Decentralized Asset Custody Layer** serves as the platform's security foundation, employing Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) to achieve truly decentralized Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal experience. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ensures that user assets remain secure and accessible even when some nodes fail. This layer completely eliminates Gas fees, significantly lowering user participation barriers.

3. **Community Governance Framework** ensures the platform's long-term sustainable development and security. The multi-signature DAO structure enables the platform to balance centralized efficiency with decentralized security, where smart contract upgrades are controlled by 4-of-7 multi-sig, while protocol revenue is managed by 3-of-5 multi-sig, ensuring key decisions are both efficient and decentralized.

### High-Speed Token Trading System

The high-speed token trading system is the core of PizzaFun's ecosystem, serving as a dynamic platform that perfectly combines traditional Bitcoin security with modern trading speed. Token creators can publish new tokens within seconds through an intuitive process, with the platform's bonding curve mechanism ensuring fairness in initial liquidity and price discovery. All transactions update instantly on built-in real-time price charts, providing traders with transparent market views.

To facilitate token discovery and trading, PizzaFun provides multi-dimensional sorting and filtering systems, including metrics such as market cap, trading volume, price changes, and holder count. The platform supports multiple token standards, initially focusing on the Runes protocol, with future expansion to other Bitcoin protocols like Ordinals and BRC-20, providing users with a unified trading experience.

The trading system introduces an innovative dual-phase mechanism:

- **Baking Phase**: Initially created tokens trade on a bonding curve (y = e^x), with 80% of token supply sold at 0.211 BTC. This mechanism ensures price rises steadily with purchase volume, preventing excessive speculation.

- **Serving Phase**: When token baking is complete, the remaining 20% of token supply plus 0.2 BTC is automatically deposited into the AMM pool, and token trading switches to AMM curve (k = X * Y), providing more mature market dynamics and bidirectional liquidity.

### Decentralized Asset Custody System

The decentralized asset custody system represents PizzaFun's core security architecture. Through innovative Slice bridging technology, Bitcoin and tokens can be safely deposited and withdrawn without trusting centralized third parties. Each transaction is verified and processed by a distributed network of entities through Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), ensuring a balance between fund security and transaction speed.

The platform's asset custody system has the following core advantages:

- **Decentralized Verification**: All transactions are verified by multi-party consensus, rather than relying on a single centralized entity
- **Fast Deposits/Withdrawals**: High-speed trading is possible after a single confirmation, without waiting for multiple block confirmations
- **Zero Gas Fees**: Transaction processing does not charge additional network fees, significantly enhancing user experience
- **Node Redundancy**: The system can operate safely even if some validation nodes go offline
- **Node Replacement Mechanism**: Unresponsive nodes can be replaced, ensuring long-term stable system operation

This innovative custody approach has been validated in well-known projects like tBTC, Arch Network, and Near, providing users with the best experience that combines Bitcoin security with modern trading speed.

### Technical Infrastructure and Governance

PizzaFun's technical infrastructure is built on core principles of security, speed, and scalability. The CrustNet backend layer achieves the breakthrough of final transaction confirmation within 2 seconds, more than 300 times faster than traditional Bitcoin networks. The security framework combines multi-signature protection, threshold signatures, and node redundancy mechanisms, ensuring high speed without sacrificing security.

The platform adopts modular architecture, enabling different protocols (Runes, Ordinals, BRC-20) to be smoothly integrated while maintaining unified user experience. System design prioritizes real-time updates, with all transactions and price movements instantly reflected in the user interface without requiring refresh or waiting for confirmation.

The governance system ensures platform security and sustainable development through a dual DAO structure:

1. **Contract DAO**: Composed of 7 members with 4-of-7 multi-signature mechanism, responsible for smart contract upgrades and technical governance, with PizzaFun team controlling only 2 signature seats, ensuring decentralized decision-making.

2. **Treasury DAO**: Composed of 5 members with 3-of-5 multi-signature mechanism, responsible for managing protocol revenue and financial decisions, with PizzaFun team holding no signature seats, achieving complete community control.

The platform implements transparent fee structure: 1% platform fee during bonding curve phase, 0.5% trading fee during AMM phase (0.3% to liquidity providers, 0.2% as platform fee). The innovative "Refer to Earn" program allocates 25% of platform fees to referrers, incentivizing community growth.

### User Experience and Scalability
