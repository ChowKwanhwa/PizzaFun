Frequently Asked Questions
What is ODIN.FUN?

Odin.Fun is the fastest way to trade tokens on Bitcoin. Create tokens in seconds. Buy and sell tokens on a pump fun style bonding curve at lightning speed. Deposit and withdraw liquidity as fast as you can click in our built-in AMM. Buy and sell along the AMM curve just as quick as the bonding curve. Everything is lightning fast and updates in real-time.

What are Bitcoin Memecoins?

Bitcoin Memecoins are tokens created and traded on the original blockchain. Bitcoin is the most decentralized, permissionless, and secure blockchain on planet earth. Deploying and trading tokens (a la memecoins) on Bitcoin just makes sense. Tokens on Bitcoin have a long history going back at least 10 years (or more): Colored Coins, Spells of Genesis, Rare Pepes, Counterparty, Ordinals, BRC-20, Runes, and a host of other Bitcoin meta-protocols. We only support the Runes protocol (for now) but we’ll be adding additional token standards as fast we can.

How is ODIN.FUN so fast?

Odin was purpose built for speed on a behind-the-scenes Bitcoin layer that we affectionately call Valhalla. Valhalla enables 2 second finality, provides decentralized Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal (TSS), and eliminates all gas fees. Just login with your Bitcoin wallet, deposit BTC, and after a single confirmation you are off to the races trading Bitcoin tokens.

What is Refer to Earn?

Refer to Earn is our initiative to grow the Odin community. Everyone should experience the pure joy of trading memecoins on Bitcoin at the speed of light, and we want you to share it with the world. If you refer a friend (click the share button anywhere on Odin) and your friend signs-up and trades, you will earn 25% of all Odin platform fees (BTC) for that user across bonding curve and AMM trades.

What does Ascend mean?

Ascend is when a token bonds. Tokens created on Odin initially trade along a bonding curve. Along the bonding curve, 80% of the token supply is sold for 0.211 BTC. Once the token bonds (aka ascends), the remaining 20% of the token supply and 0.2 BTC is deposited into an AMM pool to enable additional trading. At this point, tokens trade along the AMM curve (k = X * Y) instead of the bonding curve (y = e^x).

What is a sat?

1 sat is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. 1 sat = 0.00000001 BTC. We use sats as token prices in Odin because they are absolutely beautiful. A token starts at 0.11 sats / token ($3k market cap), ascends at 4.76 sats / token ($100k market cap), and crests $1M market cap at 47.6 sats / token.

What is Quick Buy?

Quick buy is the fastest way to buy a token. No waiting. No confirmation screens. Just a really really fast way to purchase tokens. It is best to set this to something small (like 0.00001 BTC) because you can click it as many times as you want to trigger near-instant purchases.

What is Quick Sell?

Quick sell is the fastest way to sell a token. We built Quick Sell functionality for those of you who want to sell as fast as you buy. You’ll see it conveniently located in the user profile page next to each token you own. With Quick Sell, you set the percentage of owned tokens you want to sell every time you click.

Is it safe to deposit Bitcoin to Odin.Fun?

Yes! When you deposit Bitcoin to Odin.Fun you use our Bifrost bridge. *cue flaming rainbows*. Tokens deposited to Odin.Fun are secured by a special type of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) called threshold signing (TSS). This means there is a decentralized set of entities who each have a unique private key share, and together they can receive assets and send assets at anytime. Threshold signing is a fairly popular mechanism and is used in tBTC, the Arch Network, Near, ICP, etc.

Is Odin.Fun decentralized?

Yes. Smart contract upgrades are governed by the Odin contract DAO, a 4-of-7 multisig where the Odin team is only represented by 2 of the signers. Revenue is collected by the protocol and governed by the Odin treasury DAO, a 3-of-5 multisig where the Odin team is not represented by any of the signers.

What is an AMM?

AMM stands for automated market maker. This means that you can come and swap asset A for asset B in any quantity you want whenever you want. Odin.Fun has a bonding curve feature to bootstrap new tokens, and then when tokens bond (ascend) liquidity gets deposited into an Odin AMM for instant trading along the AMM curve. Odin AMMs allow users to instantly add or remove liquidity and swap tokens.

What are the fees on Odin?

The Odin platform fee is 1% on all trades along the bonding curve (just like pump fun) and 0.5% on all AMM swaps (0.3% to liquidity providers and 0.2% platform fee). With the refer to earn program, 25% of the platform fee (0.25% along the bonding curve, 0.05% for AMM swaps) goes to the referring user.

Are there any delays or restrictions when withdrawing?

Delays: It may take up to 10 minutes to withdraw BTC as the protocol batches withdraw requests, but you can withdraw your Bitcoin and your Runes at any time. And because of the threshold signing setup (see “Is it safe to deposit Bitcoin to Odin.Fun?”), even if a few nodes become unresponsive in the TSS, the nodes can still generate a signature to withdraw your assets. The TSS setup can also replace unresponsive nodes as needed.

Restrictions: The only withdrawal restriction is there is currently a 0.0005 BTC minimum in place (to prevent spam and aggressive UTXO consolidation).

Why does Odin.Fun charge to create tokens?

We want to let everyone launch and trade Bitcoin tokens at the speed of light. Charging a small fee (3,333 sats) to create tokens discourages token spamming and hopefully gives everyone a more user-friendly trading environment.

What does “powered by BLIFE” mean?

BLIFE is a Bitcoin community ecosystem designed to connect builders, users, and Bitcoiners everywhere. We’ve integrated BLIFE ID into Odin.Fun as an identity platform (you can connect BLIFE from your profile page) and you can complete Odin quests on the BLIFE quest platform. We will continue to add additional BLIFE integrations.
